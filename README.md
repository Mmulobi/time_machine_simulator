# 🚀 Mars Time Machine - SpaceBrah Extreme

## 🛸 Overview
The **Mars Time Machine - SpaceBrah Extreme** is an interactive simulation that lets you travel through time to Mars, navigating orbital mechanics, fuel management, and time-warp physics. Experience spaceflight like never before, with real physics-based calculations and a touch of sci-fi time bending! 🌌

## 🖥️ Features
- 🌍 **Hohmann Transfer Orbit Calculations** - Realistic Mars travel time and velocity.
- 🕰 **Time Warp Mechanics** - Experience interstellar time shifts.
- ⛽ **Fuel Management System** - Adjust burn rates and avoid running out of fuel!
- 🚀 **Random Space Events** - Solar flares, time dilations, and engine boosts.
- 🛬 **3D Mars Landing Simulation** - Visualize your landing with Matplotlib.
- 🧑‍🚀 **Multiple Eras** - Travel to the past, present, or future Mars.

## 🏗 Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed, along with the following dependencies:
```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib tkinter
```

### Run the Simulation
Clone the repository and execute the script:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Mmulobi/mars-time-machine.git
cd mars-time-machine
python mars_time_machine.py
```

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **Enter your target year** (e.g., 2075 for a futuristic Mars mission).
2. **Select an era** (Past, Present, or Future).
3. **Adjust your fuel burn rate** (affects mission success!).
4. **Hit "Launch to Mars!"** and watch your journey unfold.

## 🛰 Science Behind the Simulation
The program uses **orbital mechanics** based on the **Hohmann Transfer** to calculate realistic travel times. Time-warping effects are added using a sci-fi multiplier. Fuel consumption and random events make each mission unique!

## 🤖 Future Enhancements
- ✅ Dynamic mission log updates.
- ✅ Enhanced failure and success animations.
- ⏳ AI-predicted mission outcomes.
- 🌎 Multiplayer Mars expeditions.
